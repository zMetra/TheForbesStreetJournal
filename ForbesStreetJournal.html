                <h2>Drug Cartel Allegations Emerge on Forbes Avenue, Shocking University of Pittsburgh</h2>
                <p>PITTSBURGH, PA — In an unexpected turn of events, Forbes Avenue, a bustling hub in the heart of Oakland and a lifeline for students and staff at the University of Pittsburgh, is now at the center of a growing controversy. Allegations have surfaced that a sophisticated drug cartel operation has been quietly thriving beneath the surface of the popular student hangout spots and cafes.

                    According to sources familiar with the investigation, law enforcement agencies are probing the existence of a drug ring that has allegedly been distributing illegal narcotics, including cocaine and prescription pills, to university students and residents alike. The network is rumored to span several blocks along Forbes Avenue, targeting local bars, restaurants, and off-campus housing units.
                    
                    Students in Shock
                    The revelations have sent shockwaves through the University of Pittsburgh community, with students expressing disbelief at the possibility that their seemingly safe, student-focused neighborhood might have been compromised. Many have expressed concerns for their safety, especially those who live in apartments or frequent shops along Forbes Avenue.
                    
                    “I can't believe something like this is happening right under our noses,” said Sarah Jameson, a sophomore at Pitt. “We walk down Forbes every day, we study at the cafes, and some of us even live right above the places they’re talking about. It’s terrifying to think something like this could be going on.”
                    
                    Several local businesses along the avenue have also come under scrutiny. While none have been officially named, rumors suggest that some of the well-frequented establishments may have been unwitting participants in the operation, providing cover for illegal activities.</p>
